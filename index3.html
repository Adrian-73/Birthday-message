            <h1>ðŸŽ‰Special Meassage to You ðŸŽ‰</h1>
            <p class="opening">Dear [Tavishi Sharma],</p>
            <p>Although I canâ€™t wait to share my last name with you, please know that I love your name just as much as I
                love you. You have brought so much light and joy into my life, and you are so more than I could ever ask
                for from the heavens above. Along with celebrating your birthday, today also marks the third anniversary
                of the day I confessed my love to you. I want you to know that not a single day has passed where Iâ€™ve
                regretted that decision.

                No matter how long it takesâ€”whether itâ€™s three years, thirty years, or even three lifetimesâ€”it will
                always be you. You are my forever, today and always.

            </p>
            <p>I know we have our differences and, in many ways, we're complete opposites. But isnâ€™t that part of the beauty of it? You sometimes say that I put in too much effort, but for you, I would walk through fire without a second thought.

                I understand that I havenâ€™t always been the person you could confide in without fear of judgment or offending me. I want you to know that your presence overwhelms me in the most wonderful way, and sometimes, I act impulsively because I am so in awe of you.
                
                Iâ€™m grateful for every moment with you, and even though I stumble, my heart is always in the right place.</p>
            <p>As you celebrate another year of life, I want you to know how deeply loved you are. Every smile you
                share, every laugh you create, every kind word you speakâ€”it all leaves a lasting impact on those
                fortunate enough to know you.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being the incredible person that you are. Here's to many more birthdays filled with love,
                laughter, and cherished moments. Happy Birthday, my love. You are my everything.</p>
            <p class="closing">Always Yours, Tera Aadi</p>
